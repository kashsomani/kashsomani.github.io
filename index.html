	<ul>
		<li> Birth Data Project
			<p>
				Analyzed a dataset containing upwards of 6000 baseball players 
				Observed that August had the most births, and was almost the double of July 
				Upon further research I realized that this was because the birth cut off for most Junior level baseball leagues was July 31st, giving people born in August a considerable age advantage
